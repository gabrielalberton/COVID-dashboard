[Deprecated since 20 Mar, 2020] The Brazilian Ministry of Health interrupted the release of data in real time. The reason was not informed. Subsequently, [press vehicles came together](https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/06/08/veiculos-de-comunicacao-formam-parceria-para-dar-transparencia-a-dados-de-covid-19.ghtml) to concatenate and disseminate the data. At this point, good initiatives already offered good dashboards for consultation, dispensing with the continuation of this repository.
